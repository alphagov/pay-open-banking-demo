## Usage

Make a POST request to `/v1/api/payments` with body:

```
{
  "reference": "CAKE",
  "description": "Pay for a GOV.UK Pay cake",
  "amount": 2499,
  "return_url": "https://www.google.com"
}
```

This mimics the behaviour of how a government service would integrate with the GOV.UK Pay API.

Follow the `next_url` in the response to complete the payment journey.

## Deploying

Deployed to GOV.UK PaaS.

Using cloudfoundry ci, login to PaaS and run

`cf push`

This uses manifest.yml which contains environment variables for the TrueLayer sandbox environment.
Secrets are set manually using `cf set-env`.

Requires a postgres service to be running in PaaS and bound to the app.

To push a version that points to the live TrueLayer account, use live-manifest.yml

`cf push -f live-manifest.yml`
